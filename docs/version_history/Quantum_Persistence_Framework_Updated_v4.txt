## üß© Abstract
Quantum hardware needs unified metrics for **persistence** ‚Äî how long coherence and entanglement stay usable given noise and thermodynamic cost.  
This framework defines **four measurable invariants** ‚Äî `Q_Q`, `Q_Q(ent)`, `Œµ_Q`, and `Œ†_Q` ‚Äî connecting single-qubit, entangled, thermodynamic, and device layers.  
All are **experimentally accessible or derivable from published data**.  
The framework can be implemented experimentally through a **filtration-based protocol** that measures coherence, entanglement, noise, and thermodynamic observables across controllable parameters (time, noise amplitude, temperature).  
Each invariant can be normalized to a unitless score to form a composite persistence functional `P_Q`.  
When these normalized measures behave monotonically under entropy export, `P_Q` acts as a **conditional persistence functional** describing the stability of quantum information in open systems.  
The ‚ÄúQuantum Reynolds Number‚Äù (`Re_Q`) is retained as a heuristic derived from Pareto-optimized configurations rather than a universal constant.  

Extending the framework, **Quantum Persistence can be represented topologically** through persistent homology applied to coherence and entanglement data. Persistence diagrams and multiscale Betti numbers reveal how quantum correlations survive across scales of noise, time, and temperature, generalizing `P_Q` into a persistent structural spectrum.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Toward a ‚ÄúQuantum Reynolds Number‚Äù
The idea: combine coherence (`Q_Q`), correlation persistence (`Q_Q(ent)`), thermodynamic efficiency (`Œµ_Q`), and noise immunity (`Œ†_Q`) into a dimensionless figure of merit describing *quantum information flow stability* ‚Äî analogous in spirit to classical Reynolds numbers for turbulence.  
In the revised formulation, `Re_Q` is viewed as a **task-specific dimensionless indicator** emerging from normalized invariants on the Pareto front, providing a practical rather than absolute boundary between coherent and decoherent regimes.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Operational Construction and Normalization of P_Q

To render the persistence functional experimentally and computationally tractable, each invariant is normalized to a dimensionless resource score `n_i ‚àà [0,1]` representing its relative performance within a given task or architecture.

For each raw measure `M_i` (coherence, entanglement, efficiency, noise immunity):

```
n_i = (M_i - M_i(min)) / (M_i(max) - M_i(min))
```
or, for robustness to noise and heavy tails:

```
n_i = 1 / (1 + exp(-(M_i - Œº_i)/œÉ_i))
```

The normalized persistence functional is then defined as either a weighted sum or geometric mean:

```
P_Q = Œ£_i w_i n_i   or   P_Q = Œ†_i n_i^(w_i)
```
with `Œ£_i w_i = 1` and `w_i ‚â• 0`, where the weights reflect the importance of each resource for the operational task (computation, metrology, heat engine, etc.).

### üîπ Monotonicity Postulate
If each `n_i(t)` is a monotonic resource measure under open-system (Lindblad) dynamics, then:

```
dP_Q/dt ‚â§ 0,     dP_Q/dE_env < 0
```

Thus, persistence decreases with time and entropy export.  
This reframes `P_Q` as a **conditional monotonic functional**, analogous to a Lyapunov function for quantum-information stability.

### üîπ Pareto-Front Interpretation
Because the normalized scores `n_i` are typically non-commensurate, the set of achievable `{n_i}` forms a Pareto front representing trade-offs between coherence, entanglement lifetime, thermodynamic efficiency, and noise robustness.  
Scalar `P_Q` values correspond to specific choices of task priorities or operating points on that front.  
The previously introduced ‚ÄúQuantum Reynolds Number‚Äù (`Re_Q`) may be interpreted as a heuristic derived from Pareto-optimized configurations rather than as a universal invariant.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Experimental and Measurement Implementation

To bridge theory with experiment, the Quantum Persistence framework can be expressed as a *filtration-based measurement protocol*.

### **Filtration variables**
Let  
- `t`: physical time under open dynamics  
- `Œª`: noise amplitude or system‚Äìbath coupling  
- `T`: bath temperature  
- `Œ¥`: measurement resolution  

Each defines a trajectory (‚Äúfiltration‚Äù) along which coherence, entanglement, and thermodynamic quantities evolve.

### **Primitive measurable quantities**
1. **Coherence spectrum** `{C_k}` ‚Äî magnitude of off-diagonal density matrix blocks, measurable via tomography or randomized measurement.  
2. **Entanglement spectrum/witnesses** ‚Äî eigenvalues or negativities across bipartitions, measurable via two-copy or witness protocols.  
3. **Noise response functions** ‚Äî derivatives of observables w.r.t. `Œª`, e.g. `dC/dŒª`, `dN/dŒª`.  
4. **Thermodynamic observables** ‚Äî non-equilibrium free energy, ergotropy, entropy production, and heat flow.  

### **Persistence invariants**
- **Persistence lifetime** `œÑ`: the interval where a resource monotone remains above threshold.  
- **Integrated invariants:** `‚à´ M dŒ±`, total ‚Äúarea‚Äù under a monotone over a filter.  
- **Critical thresholds** (`Œª_c`, `T_c`): points where a resource collapses sharply.  
- **Spectral gap persistence:** lifetime of nonzero Liouvillian gap.  

### **Data analysis**
- Compute persistence diagrams (birth/death pairs) for coherence or entanglement spectra.  
- Normalize to `[0, 1]` and aggregate as `P_Q = Œ£_i w_i n_i` or `P_Q = Œ†_i n_i^(w_i)`.  
- Apply Pareto-front analysis to explore trade-offs and identify optimal configurations.

### **Measurement scalability**
- *Small systems:* full tomography and direct spectral analysis.  
- *Medium‚Äìlarge systems:* classical shadows, randomized benchmarking, and noise spectroscopy.  
- *Thermodynamic channels:* calorimetric or inferred energy measurements.

### **Resource-theory consistency**
Use monotones valid under the corresponding free operations; define persistence invariants as monotone functions of these quantities to preserve operational meaning.

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Topological and Persistent-Homology Formulation

The Quantum Persistence framework can be extended using **topological data analysis (TDA)** applied to experimentally estimated quantum data.

### **Filtration Construction**
Define a filtration parameter (time `t`, noise strength `Œª`, temperature `T`, or measurement resolution `Œ¥`).  
At each filtration value, compute experimentally accessible quantities such as coherence and entanglement spectra, correlation or fidelity matrices, or reduced density matrices of subsystems.  
These form weighted graphs or simplicial complexes that evolve with the filtration.

### **Persistent Homology and Invariants**
1. **Persistence Diagrams:** birth‚Äìdeath pairs of topological features (connected components, cycles, voids) obtained from correlation or distance filtrations.  
   - 0D (Betti-0): correlation clusters  
   - 1D (Betti-1): cyclic or looped correlations  
   - Higher D: multipartite or higher-order correlations  

2. **Persistence Lifetimes and Total Persistence:**  
   Scalar summaries such as the total lifetime ‚àë(death‚àíbirth) or L‚Çö norms of persistence points.

3. **Persistence Landscapes / Silhouettes:**  
   Vector or functional representations of persistence diagrams enabling statistical comparison between experiments.

4. **Bottleneck / Wasserstein Distances:**  
   Quantify how correlation topology evolves between states or time steps.

### **Persistent Resource Measures**
- **Persistent Entanglement:** build diagrams from negativity or concurrence of reduced states across scales.  
- **Persistent Coherence:** track l‚ÇÅ- or relative-entropy coherence metrics over filtrations.  
- **Spectral Persistence:** follow eigenvalue/rank changes in density or correlation matrices.  
- **Persistent Mutual Information / Fisher Information:** measure robustness of information-theoretic structure.

### **Interpretation**
Long-lived (high-persistence) features indicate **robust quantum correlations** resistant to decoherence or coarse-graining, whereas short-lived features correspond to **fragile or noise-sensitive structure**.  
This representation extends `P_Q` from a single functional to a **persistent spectrum** that captures the geometry and topology of coherence across experimental scales.

### **Experimental Path**
- **Data Sources:** correlators, reduced density matrices, fidelity matrices  
- **Measurement:** tomography or randomized measurement (classical shadows)  
- **Analysis Tools:** Ripser, GUDHI, Dionysus, or similar persistent-homology libraries

## üîü Limitations & Next Steps
- `Q_Q(ent)` still requires direct multi-qubit coherence lifetime data.  
- `Œ†_Q` requires noise-spectrum calibration.  
- `Œµ_Q` needs standardization of `P_eff` protocols.  
- Validate the normalized persistence functional `P_Q` using published data or simulations of open-system dynamics to test the monotonic relation `dP_Q/dE_env < 0` and identify the empirical `Re_Q` threshold.  
- Extend the measurement implementation section using published persistence-diagram methods from topological data analysis (TDA).  
- Evaluate persistent-homology results on real experimental data to verify correspondence with theoretical persistence lifetimes.
