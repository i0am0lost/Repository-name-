## üß© Abstract
Quantum hardware needs unified metrics for **persistence** ‚Äî how long coherence and entanglement stay usable given noise and thermodynamic cost.  
This framework defines **four measurable invariants** ‚Äî `Q_Q`, `Q_Q(ent)`, `Œµ_Q`, and `Œ†_Q` ‚Äî connecting single-qubit, entangled, thermodynamic, and device layers.  
All are **experimentally accessible or derivable from published data**.  
Each invariant can be normalized to a unitless score to form a composite persistence functional `P_Q`.  
When these normalized measures behave monotonically under entropy export, `P_Q` acts as a **conditional persistence functional** describing the stability of quantum information in open systems.  
The ‚ÄúQuantum Reynolds Number‚Äù (`Re_Q`) is retained as a heuristic derived from Pareto-optimized configurations rather than a universal constant.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Toward a ‚ÄúQuantum Reynolds Number‚Äù
The idea: combine coherence (`Q_Q`), correlation persistence (`Q_Q(ent)`), thermodynamic efficiency (`Œµ_Q`), and noise immunity (`Œ†_Q`) into a dimensionless figure of merit describing *quantum information flow stability* ‚Äî analogous in spirit to classical Reynolds numbers for turbulence.  
In the revised formulation, `Re_Q` is viewed as a **task-specific dimensionless indicator** emerging from normalized invariants on the Pareto front, providing a practical rather than absolute boundary between coherent and decoherent regimes.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Operational Construction and Normalization of P_Q

To render the persistence functional experimentally and computationally tractable, each invariant is normalized to a dimensionless resource score `n_i ‚àà [0,1]` representing its relative performance within a given task or architecture.

For each raw measure `M_i` (coherence, entanglement, efficiency, noise immunity):

```
n_i = (M_i - M_i(min)) / (M_i(max) - M_i(min))
```
or, for robustness to noise and heavy tails:

```
n_i = 1 / (1 + exp(-(M_i - Œº_i)/œÉ_i))
```

The normalized persistence functional is then defined as either a weighted sum or geometric mean:

```
P_Q = Œ£_i w_i n_i   or   P_Q = Œ†_i n_i^(w_i)
```
with `Œ£_i w_i = 1` and `w_i ‚â• 0`, where the weights reflect the importance of each resource for the operational task (computation, metrology, heat engine, etc.).

### üîπ Monotonicity Postulate
If each `n_i(t)` is a monotonic resource measure under open-system (Lindblad) dynamics, then:

```
dP_Q/dt ‚â§ 0,     dP_Q/dE_env < 0
```

Thus, persistence decreases with time and entropy export.  
This reframes `P_Q` as a **conditional monotonic functional**, analogous to a Lyapunov function for quantum-information stability.

### üîπ Pareto-Front Interpretation
Because the normalized scores `n_i` are typically non-commensurate, the set of achievable `{n_i}` forms a Pareto front representing trade-offs between coherence, entanglement lifetime, thermodynamic efficiency, and noise robustness.  
Scalar `P_Q` values correspond to specific choices of task priorities or operating points on that front.  
The previously introduced ‚ÄúQuantum Reynolds Number‚Äù (`Re_Q`) may be interpreted as a heuristic derived from Pareto-optimized configurations rather than as a universal invariant.

[Existing table of invariants and validation status remains unchanged.]

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Limitations & Next Steps
- `Q_Q(ent)` still requires direct multi-qubit coherence lifetime data.  
- `Œ†_Q` requires noise-spectrum calibration.  
- `Œµ_Q` needs standardization of `P_eff` protocols.  
- Validate the normalized persistence functional `P_Q` using published data or simulations of open-system dynamics to test the monotonic relation `dP_Q/dE_env < 0` and identify the empirical `Re_Q` threshold.

### ‚úÖ Overall Legitimacy Verdict
‚âà 90% credible framework; fully grounded after normalization and conditional monotonicity formalization.  
Theoretical structure now aligns with multi-objective benchmarking methods and resource-theoretic consistency.  
The ‚ÄúQuantum Reynolds Number‚Äù remains heuristic but experimentally approachable through Pareto-optimized persistence analysis.
