I’m not a physicist by training, but I’ve been reading about open quantum systems and coherence loss.  
I tried to formalize what I understood into a single “persistence” quantity that combines coherence, entanglement lifetime, thermodynamic efficiency, and noise immunity.

### Basic structure

$$
P_Q = F(Q_Q,\, Q_Q^{(\mathrm{ent})},\, \varepsilon_Q,\, \Pi_Q) \in [0,1]
$$

where:

- $Q_Q = \omega_q T_2$ (single-qubit coherence quality)  
- $Q_Q^{(\mathrm{ent})} = \omega_c T_2^{(\mathrm{ent})}$ (entanglement persistence)  
- $\varepsilon_Q = \dfrac{\omega_q k_B T_{\mathrm{sink}}}{P_{\mathrm{eff}}}$ (thermodynamic efficiency of coherence)  
- $\Pi_Q = \dfrac{\omega_q}{\Gamma_\phi}$ (noise-spectrum immunity)

and I suggest a **“Quantum Reynolds Number”**:

$$
\mathrm{Re}_Q = Q_Q^{(\mathrm{ent})} \, \varepsilon_Q \, \Pi_Q^{-1}.
$$

### Conceptual intent

The idea is just to ask:

Would such a functional or dimensionless ratio make *any* sense under standard open-quantum-system theory (e.g., Breuer & Petruccione, *The Theory of Open Quantum Systems*, 2002)?

Could a monotonic relationship

$$
\frac{dP_Q}{dE_{\mathrm{env}}} < 0
$$

— i.e., persistence decreases with entropy export — follow from Lindblad-type dynamics,  
or is that incompatible with how decoherence is typically treated?

### Notes

I’m **not claiming a new law** — I’m only trying to understand whether this sort of composite invariant could, in principle, exist in real systems.

Any critique or pointers to where my assumptions break down would be really helpful.  
I appreciate any guidance — I’m just an interested layperson trying to learn.

### ✅ Posting notes

- Use **Preview** before saving to confirm equations render correctly.  
- Ignore any automatic “MathJax tutorial” comment — it’s just the site helping first-time users.  
- Make sure each displayed equation has an empty line above and below it.  
- If you edit again later, don’t use parentheses or square brackets around formulas — always `$` or `$$`.

This version should display perfectly, with  
$$
\frac{dP_Q}{dE_{\mathrm{env}}} < 0
$$  
rendered exactly as you intended.
