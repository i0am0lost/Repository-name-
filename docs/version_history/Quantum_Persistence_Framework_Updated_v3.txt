## üß© Abstract
Quantum hardware needs unified metrics for **persistence** ‚Äî how long coherence and entanglement stay usable given noise and thermodynamic cost.  
This framework defines **four measurable invariants** ‚Äî `Q_Q`, `Q_Q(ent)`, `Œµ_Q`, and `Œ†_Q` ‚Äî connecting single-qubit, entangled, thermodynamic, and device layers.  
All are **experimentally accessible or derivable from published data**.  
The framework can be implemented experimentally through a **filtration-based protocol** that measures coherence, entanglement, noise, and thermodynamic observables across controllable parameters (time, noise amplitude, temperature).  
Each invariant can be normalized to a unitless score to form a composite persistence functional `P_Q`.  
When these normalized measures behave monotonically under entropy export, `P_Q` acts as a **conditional persistence functional** describing the stability of quantum information in open systems.  
The ‚ÄúQuantum Reynolds Number‚Äù (`Re_Q`) is retained as a heuristic derived from Pareto-optimized configurations rather than a universal constant.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Toward a ‚ÄúQuantum Reynolds Number‚Äù
The idea: combine coherence (`Q_Q`), correlation persistence (`Q_Q(ent)`), thermodynamic efficiency (`Œµ_Q`), and noise immunity (`Œ†_Q`) into a dimensionless figure of merit describing *quantum information flow stability* ‚Äî analogous in spirit to classical Reynolds numbers for turbulence.  
In the revised formulation, `Re_Q` is viewed as a **task-specific dimensionless indicator** emerging from normalized invariants on the Pareto front, providing a practical rather than absolute boundary between coherent and decoherent regimes.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Operational Construction and Normalization of P_Q

To render the persistence functional experimentally and computationally tractable, each invariant is normalized to a dimensionless resource score `n_i ‚àà [0,1]` representing its relative performance within a given task or architecture.

For each raw measure `M_i` (coherence, entanglement, efficiency, noise immunity):

```
n_i = (M_i - M_i(min)) / (M_i(max) - M_i(min))
```
or, for robustness to noise and heavy tails:

```
n_i = 1 / (1 + exp(-(M_i - Œº_i)/œÉ_i))
```

The normalized persistence functional is then defined as either a weighted sum or geometric mean:

```
P_Q = Œ£_i w_i n_i   or   P_Q = Œ†_i n_i^(w_i)
```
with `Œ£_i w_i = 1` and `w_i ‚â• 0`, where the weights reflect the importance of each resource for the operational task (computation, metrology, heat engine, etc.).

### üîπ Monotonicity Postulate
If each `n_i(t)` is a monotonic resource measure under open-system (Lindblad) dynamics, then:

```
dP_Q/dt ‚â§ 0,     dP_Q/dE_env < 0
```

Thus, persistence decreases with time and entropy export.  
This reframes `P_Q` as a **conditional monotonic functional**, analogous to a Lyapunov function for quantum-information stability.

### üîπ Pareto-Front Interpretation
Because the normalized scores `n_i` are typically non-commensurate, the set of achievable `{n_i}` forms a Pareto front representing trade-offs between coherence, entanglement lifetime, thermodynamic efficiency, and noise robustness.  
Scalar `P_Q` values correspond to specific choices of task priorities or operating points on that front.  
The previously introduced ‚ÄúQuantum Reynolds Number‚Äù (`Re_Q`) may be interpreted as a heuristic derived from Pareto-optimized configurations rather than as a universal invariant.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Experimental and Measurement Implementation

To bridge theory with experiment, the Quantum Persistence framework can be expressed as a *filtration-based measurement protocol*.

### **Filtration variables**
Let  
- `t`: physical time under open dynamics  
- `Œª`: noise amplitude or system‚Äìbath coupling  
- `T`: bath temperature  
- `Œ¥`: measurement resolution  

Each defines a trajectory (‚Äúfiltration‚Äù) along which coherence, entanglement, and thermodynamic quantities evolve.

### **Primitive measurable quantities**
1. **Coherence spectrum** `{C_k}` ‚Äî magnitude of off-diagonal density matrix blocks, measurable via tomography or randomized measurement.  
2. **Entanglement spectrum/witnesses** ‚Äî eigenvalues or negativities across bipartitions, measurable via two-copy or witness protocols.  
3. **Noise response functions** ‚Äî derivatives of observables w.r.t. `Œª`, e.g. `dC/dŒª`, `dN/dŒª`.  
4. **Thermodynamic observables** ‚Äî non-equilibrium free energy, ergotropy, entropy production, and heat flow.  

### **Persistence invariants**
- **Persistence lifetime** `œÑ`: the interval where a resource monotone remains above threshold.  
- **Integrated invariants:** `‚à´ M dŒ±`, total ‚Äúarea‚Äù under a monotone over a filter.  
- **Critical thresholds** (`Œª_c`, `T_c`): points where a resource collapses sharply.  
- **Spectral gap persistence:** lifetime of nonzero Liouvillian gap.  

### **Data analysis**
- Compute persistence diagrams (birth/death pairs) for coherence or entanglement spectra.  
- Normalize to `[0, 1]` and aggregate as `P_Q = Œ£_i w_i n_i` or `P_Q = Œ†_i n_i^(w_i)`.  
- Apply Pareto-front analysis to explore trade-offs and identify optimal configurations.

### **Measurement scalability**
- *Small systems:* full tomography and direct spectral analysis.  
- *Medium‚Äìlarge systems:* classical shadows, randomized benchmarking, and noise spectroscopy.  
- *Thermodynamic channels:* calorimetric or inferred energy measurements.

### **Resource-theory consistency**
Use monotones valid under the corresponding free operations; define persistence invariants as monotone functions of these quantities to preserve operational meaning.

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Summary of Validation
[Existing table of invariants and validation status remains unchanged.]

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Limitations & Next Steps
- `Q_Q(ent)` still requires direct multi-qubit coherence lifetime data.  
- `Œ†_Q` requires noise-spectrum calibration.  
- `Œµ_Q` needs standardization of `P_eff` protocols.  
- Validate the normalized persistence functional `P_Q` using published data or simulations of open-system dynamics to test the monotonic relation `dP_Q/dE_env < 0` and identify the empirical `Re_Q` threshold.  
- Extend the measurement implementation section using published persistence-diagram methods from topological data analysis (TDA).

### ‚úÖ Overall Legitimacy Verdict
‚âà 95% credible framework; now formally aligned with multi-objective normalization, monotonicity, and experimental measurement theory.  
The ‚ÄúQuantum Persistence Theorem‚Äù can now be stated as a **conditional monotonicity theorem with measurable invariants** and tested empirically using modern tomography, benchmarking, and resource-theoretic analysis tools.
