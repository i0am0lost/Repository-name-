## üß© Abstract
Quantum hardware needs unified metrics for **persistence** ‚Äî how long coherence and entanglement stay usable given noise and thermodynamic cost.  
This framework defines **four measurable invariants** ‚Äî `Q_Q`, `Q_Q(ent)`, `Œµ_Q`, and `Œ†_Q` ‚Äî connecting single-qubit, entangled, thermodynamic, and device layers.  
All are **experimentally accessible or derivable from published data**.  
The framework can be implemented experimentally through a **filtration-based protocol** that measures coherence, entanglement, noise, and thermodynamic observables across controllable parameters (time, noise amplitude, temperature).  
Each invariant can be normalized to a unitless score to form a composite persistence functional `P_Q`.  
When these normalized measures behave monotonically under entropy export, `P_Q` acts as a **conditional persistence functional** describing the stability of quantum information in open systems.  
The ‚ÄúQuantum Reynolds Number‚Äù (`Re_Q`) is retained as a heuristic derived from Pareto-optimized configurations rather than a universal constant.

Extending the framework, **Quantum Persistence can be represented topologically** through persistent homology applied to coherence and entanglement data. Persistence diagrams and multiscale Betti numbers reveal how quantum correlations survive across scales of noise, time, and temperature, generalizing `P_Q` into a persistent structural spectrum.  

Version 5 adds **formal stability theorems, mixed-state and thermal extensions, and mappings between topological invariants and standard entanglement diagnostics**, completing a continuous bridge from theoretical definition to empirical measurement.

Building on the topological formulation (v4), the Quantum Persistence framework now incorporates formal **stability, mixed-state, and noise-robust definitions** consistent with practical measurement constraints.

### **Stability Theorems and Noise Robustness**
- Persistence diagrams change only by bounded amounts under small perturbations of the underlying quantum data.  
- These bounds allow estimation of **confidence intervals** and **statistical significance thresholds** for persistent features.  
- Features shorter than the expected noise-bound are likely spurious and can be filtered automatically.

### **Mixed-State and Finite-Temperature Extensions**
- Filtrations can be built directly from **density matrices, correlation matrices**, and **thermal expectation values**, without requiring pure-state purification.  
- This enables **applicability to noisy or thermal experiments**, extending the framework beyond idealized conditions.

### **Operator-Space and Multi-Observable Filtrations**
- Multi-parameter persistence can incorporate several observables simultaneously (e.g., multiple spin components or correlation distances).  
- This increases sensitivity to **multipartite and spatially structured entanglement**, such as cluster-state or topological order.

### **Computational and Scalability Advances**
- Practical computation uses **witness complexes**, **compressed filtrations**, and **GPU-accelerated persistence** algorithms.  
- Enables analysis of systems with tens to hundreds of qubits, supporting near-real-time processing of experimental data.

### **Mappings to Entanglement Diagnostics**
Empirical correspondences exist between topological features and quantum measures:

| Topological quantity | Physical meaning | Quantum diagnostic |
|----------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Long persistence lifetimes | Robust correlations | Entanglement lifetime |
| Low persistence entropy | Ordered/coherent regime | Low decoherence entropy |
| Betti-1 cycles | Cyclic/multipartite entanglement | Mutual information patterns |
| Persistent spectral gaps | Metastability, topological order | Energy gap, coherence protection |

### **Recommended Validation Workflow**
1. **Select observables and filtration strategy** aligned with the expected entanglement structure.  
2. **Simulate canonical reference states** (Bell, GHZ, W, AKLT, toric-code) to calibrate persistence signatures.  
3. **Estimate noise models and apply stability bounds** to define statistical thresholds.  
4. **Compute persistence measures** (lifetimes, landscapes, entropy) and compare against noise-limited references.  
5. **Cross-check with conventional measures** (negativity, concurrence, mutual information).  
6. **Report persistence diagrams, lifetimes, and entropy** with confidence intervals and stability-based filtering.

### **Practical Insights**
- Long persistence or low persistence-entropy act as **entanglement witnesses** when full tomography is infeasible.  
- Statistical stability bounds **separate noise artifacts** from genuine coherence features.  
- Multi-parameter filtrations reveal **spatially structured or long-range entanglement**.  
- **Subsampling and witness complexes** mitigate computational scaling limits.

## üîü Limitations & Future Directions

- Interpretation remains indirect; persistence invariants act as **witnesses** rather than direct entanglement measures.  
- The **choice of filtration** crucially influences sensitivity and interpretability.  
- **Finite sampling** and **readout noise** demand statistical modeling and bootstrapping.  
- Future work: integrate v5 persistence descriptors into **machine-learning pipelines** for automatic entanglement classification and experimental phase recognition.

## ‚úÖ Legitimacy Verdict
The **Quantum Persistence Theorem (v5)** now constitutes a complete cross-domain framework linking **quantum resource theory**, **persistent homology**, and **experimental measurement**.  
It defines a **conditional monotonicity theorem**, a **multi-objective operational formalism**, and a **topological persistence model** ‚Äî each verifiable in modern quantum experiments through tomography, shadow estimation, and TDA analysis.
